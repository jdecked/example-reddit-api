# example-reddit-api

This project was bootstrapped using [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is the GitHub repo for the Redux advanced tutorial's [Reddit API Example](https://redux.js.org/advanced/exampleredditapi). The sole difference between this code and the tutorial code is that I've replaced use of `prop-types` with the more modern static type checker `flow` ([more about Flow here](https://flow.org)).

## Installation

In the project directory, run `yarn install`. If you don't yet have `yarn`, you can get it via npm by running `npm install -g yarn`.

## Running
