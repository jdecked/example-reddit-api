# example-reddit-api

This project was bootstrapped using [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is the GitHub repo for the Redux advanced tutorial's [Reddit API Example](https://redux.js.org/advanced/exampleredditapi). The sole difference between this code and the tutorial code is that I've replaced use of `prop-types` with the more modern static type checker `flow` ([more about Flow here](https://flow.org)).

There are also tests here using Jest and [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/), since I originally made this repo to teach a class on testing for React, but feel free to ignore them if that's not what you've wound up here for.
